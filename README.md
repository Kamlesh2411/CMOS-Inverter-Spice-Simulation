# CMOS-Inverter-Spice-Simulation

This project involves the design and simulation of a CMOS inverter using both PMOS and NMOS transistors. A detailed netlist for the CMOS inverter circuit has been created,
capturing the connections and configurations of the transistors. The simulation was carried out to analyze the switching behavior, power consumption, and performance metrics of the inverter.
The results from the simulation provide insights into the inverter's behavior under various conditions, including voltage and load variations. This project demonstrates the application of CMOS technology
in logic design and its effectiveness in digital circuits. The simulation was successfully executed using SPICE tools to verify the circuit's functionality.
